Caveats
=======

## Shorthand

Shorthand syntax is generally avoided, in part because its complex structure is often difficult to represent at the type level, and also because [it might be an anti-pattern](https://csswizardry.com/2016/12/css-shorthand-syntax-considered-an-anti-pattern/).

## Vendor prefixes

You may want to consider applying [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to the CSS output to improve your style sheet's compatibility with older browsers.
